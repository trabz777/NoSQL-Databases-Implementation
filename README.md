# NoSQL-Databases-Redis-Cassandra-MongoDB-Neo4J-JSON
This report documents the implementation of 4 major types of NoSQL databases - Key/Value pair (Redis), Column-oriented (Cassandra), Document-based (MongoDB) and Graph database (Neo4J). It also includes the implementation/validation of JSON schema for a specific use-case.   

The data used for each implementation has logical meaning to it and holds a structure and relationship between different entities. Each implementation has the data/schema creation stage and then the querying stage where im querying information from the dataset. Please read the whole report carefully to have full understanding of the implementation these selected NoSQL Databases. 

Operating system used is Linux (centos-release-7-9.2009.1.el7.centos.x86_64). For JSON schema creation and validation, normal windows or linux browser can be used

NOTE: This report/implementation was carried out all by myself for my university coursework. This can be used as an initial guide for someone who wants to have a peek at the implementation of most common NoSQL databases being used for hundereds of different requirements.
